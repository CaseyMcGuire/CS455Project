	<li><code>sudo /sbin/service httpd status </code> </li>
	<li><code>DirectoryRoot</code> is the directory from which documents are served whereas <code>ServerRoot</code> is the top of the directory tree under which the server's configuration, error, and log files are kept.</li>
	<li>Our server listens on port 80.</li>
	<li>You places those files in <code>/var/www/html/</code>.</li>
	<li>The web server must have permissions of 711, the <code>public_html</code> must have permissions of 755, and the documents therein must be world-readable. Additionally, you must comment out the line <code>UserDir disabled</code> and add the line <code>UserDir public_html</code>.</li>
	<li>Traffic logs are stored in the <code>logs/access_log</code> file. Error logs are contained in the <code>logs/error_log</code> file.</li>
	<li>The directory index file is the file that Apache will serve if a directory is requested. Its a good idea for all directories to have one so that users cannot see your directory structure.</li>

	<li>You need to have a <code>.htpasswd</code> file stored somewhere on your web server that is not accessible to users.  In this file you will store the passwords for all verified users (those who can see the file or directory you're trying to password protect).  In another file,<code> .htaccess</code>, you specify the path to the<code> .htpasswd</code> file, the name of the page that is being protected, and the name of the file or files that are being protected (which will be accessed via the protected page). </li>
	<li>This can be including the line <code>ErrorDocument 404 /path/to/page</code> in the <code>config</code> file.</li>
	<li>A <code>GET</code> request is used to retrieve a document from the server with the given URI. A <code>HEAD</code> request is identical to a <code>GET</code> request except that it includes only the header information. A <code>POST</code> request is used to send data <span class="italic">to</span> the server. </li>
